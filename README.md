App Toolkit for Android
==================

**Explore smart components that powers all of our Android apps.**

App Toolkit is a clean and lightweight demo app that showcases the reusable screens, components, and
architecture powering my Android projects.

It includes a live preview of all the shared UI elements I’ve built for my apps — such as Settings,
Help, Support, and more — as well as a dynamic list of my published apps from Google Play.

Whether you’re a developer, designer, or just curious about how modern Android apps are structured,
App Toolkit gives you a hands-on look at the foundational UI blocks behind my work.

Our app is designed to be simple and easy to use, while also being fast and lightweight. Plus, it's
free and open-source software!

# How it works

App Toolkit uses a modular architecture with a shared core that powers every screen. The home screen
dynamically fetches all apps I’ve published on Google Play and allows you to open or install them
with one tap. Every screen is live and functional — just like it appears in real apps.

# Get started today
